# What is Steganography

If encryption can be thought of as the encoding of data for confidentiality,
then steganography is the encoding of data to obscure the fact that the data
is there at all.

# But why?

* Encryption can be noisy / obvious.
* So are most backdoors, remote commands, random network ports
* How can we transmit data between two parties when we know  that even the *detection* 
  of a transmission could cause harm?
