## Key Signing Party!!

* 3 GRADED Tasks for today
  * Mkijowski signed public key (pilot dropbox)
  * YOUR thrice-signed public key (pilot dropbox)
  * Sign three other students keys (pilot dropbox)  

---

# It's going to be a lame party isn't it...

You all should have run the following and uploaded it to pilot:

`gpg --full-generate-key`

* Use your real name and campus email!
* Use all the bits (4096)!
* Feel free to set an expiration of 16w (weeks) if you plan on throwing this away ***AT THE END OF THIS SEMESTER***
* Use a password that you will not forget!
* We will use this key again so make sure you save it!

---

# Goals for today

* Establish trust with instructor (and 3 other students in this class)
* Import the public key ring for this class
* Sign and Return my public key
* Sign 3 other keys and upload
* Get your key signed by three others

---

# Import my public key

* Attempt 1: `gpg --recv-keys E47763416159625F60ACE88A7E5CF54E1BBA3984`
* Attempt 2: `gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E47763416159625F60ACE88A7E5CF54E1BBA3984`

OR

Copy and paste the contents (from `kijowski-gpg/`) into a file in linux and import it with:

* `gpg --import kijowski.gpg`
* OR: `gpg --import kijowski.gpg.pub.txt`

---

# Check fingerprint, sign my key

```
E477 6341 6159 625F 60AC  E88A 7E5C F54E 1BBA 3984 <- Look at last 16 of output for fingerprint
                               7E5C F54E 1BBA 3984 <- This is what I am assuring you is my key fingerprint
```

* `gpg --list-key matthew.kijowski@wright.edu`
* `gpg --edit-key matthew.kijowski@wright.edu`
* `sign`
* `save`
* `gpg --armor --export matthew.kijowski@wright.edu`

***Return this key to me via pilot dropbox AS A PLAIN TEXT FILE!***

# Lets refresh hashing and Asymmetric encryption

A hash gaurantees integrity (message has not changed).

Public key can decrypt messages from private. (Authenticity)

Private key can decrypt messages from public. (Confidentiality)

---

# Lets party!

* Convince your table mates that you are the person with the given email and share your fingerprint!
* Exchange public keys (send/recv or just export and email/discord)
  * `gpg --armor --export YOUR.email@wright.edu`
* Import `gpg --import their-filename` OR `gpg --recv-keys`
* Sign `gpg --edit-key THEIR.email@wright.edu` > `sign` > `save`
* Return signed key to them reverse of above exchange
  * `gpg --armor --export THEIR.email@wright.edu`
* Import your new signatures `gpg --import filename`

---

# Among your table (and Discord)

* Download/copy/paste each person's public key from discord
* Make a file in your home directory for each key
* Files should start with `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`
* Import with the following

`gpg import <filename>`

---

# Day 2 (what are we even doing?)

* Exchanging keys
* Establishing a Web of Trust!

## But what else can we be doing...

* `gpg --list-sigs <Email or Fingerprint>`

---

# Signed sealed delivered

Lets sign a message!

* Create a `sample.txt` file with a public message (Hello World or some such thing).
* `gpg --sign sample.txt`
* share the output sample.gpg with someone you exchanged keys with
* `cat` the output file, can you read the contents?
* `gpg --verify sample.gpg`

## Other signing options

* `gpg --clear-sign`
* `gpg --detach-sign`

---

# Now for some fun

Lets send a secret message!

* Create a text file `secret-message.txt`
* Choose someone you have exchanged keys with
* Encrypt the file: `gpg --output secret-message.gpg --encrypt --recipient their.email@wright.edu`
* Send them `secret-message.txt` via email or discord
* The recipient can decrypt with:
  * `gpg --output secret.txt --decrypt secret-message.gpg`

--- 

# Back up your gpg keys!!!

`tar -cpzf gnupg.tar.gz ~/.gnupg/`

if you are using a Wright State laptop

`cp gnupg.tar.gz /mnt/c/Users/student/Desktop/`

Save this file!!!

You can also backup your private key and any public keys with:

* `gpg --armor --export-secret-key your.email@wright.edu > mysecretkey.gpg`
* `gpg --armor --export > allpubkeys.gpg`

---

# (Web of Trust)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust]

Decentralized trust network similar to what we have done in class.

* Hard to attack
* easy to lose private key
* hard to get started as a new user (how do you gain trust?)

---

# Wouldn't it be nice

* Lets pretend we are lazy...
* How would you improve the Web of Trust?

---

# I really hope we invented a Certificate Authority...

## Raise your hand if you know the following companies

* Thawte
* Comodo
* WoSign
* Symantec
* GoDaddy

# PKI

The methods, policies, roles, hardware, software, and procedures that facilitate creating, managing, distributing, using, storing, and revoking public keys is called a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
