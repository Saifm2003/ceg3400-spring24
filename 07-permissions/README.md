# Linux Users and File Permissions

### Some administration:

* Lab 4 will be assigned next Thursday
* `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group` and you.

### Topics:

* Users
* Files
* Users, Groups, and Others (everyone else)
* basic and advanced permissions
* sudo, root, and permissions
* File Access Control Lists (ACL)

---

# GPG last words (for now)

* Backup your `~/.gnupg` folder!
* You can export all public keys at once!
* Check your grades!
* I'm almost done exclaiming!!!
* alright, we're good now

---

# Passwords, passwd, and you

some notes:

* `passwd` - the command to reset user passwords
* `/etc/passwd` - the file that stores user information, but NOT their password OR hashed password
* `/etc/shadow` - the file that stores user password hashes (with salts!)
* `/etc/group` - the file that stores group information including group members

# Everything is a file

| File Type | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | `-` | normal file |
| Directory | `d` | normal directory |
| Hard link | `-` | additional name for existing file |
| Symbolic link | `l` | shortcut to a file or directory |
| Socket | `s` | used to pass data between two processes |
| Named pipe | `p` | socket but users cannot work directly with pipes |
| Character device | `c` | processes character hardware communications |
| Block device | `b` | processes block hardware communications |

# Users

> In Linux, a user is an entity that can manipulate files (and some other things...)

Users have some of the following properties:

* Real name <- for everyone else
* User name <- for sysadmin / the user
* User ID   <- (UID) what the computer actually works with
* Group(s)  <- Similar to users, the computer doesnt care about t he group name, it checks a GID
* password(?)

# Files belong to users (and groups)

Linux file permissions are associated with the following three groups of users:

* the **U**ser that owns the file
* the **G**roup that the file belongs to
* **O**ther users (everyone else, sometimes **W**orld)

* You can change the owner and group with `chown` and `chgrp` respectively.
* You can check members of groups via the `/etc/group` file with `cat`.

---

# Running processes have users and groups too!

This mean a process has the same permissions as the user that the process is running as!

## UID's and processes

Three types of UID's 

1. **Real UID**: UID of parent process (whoever is running the process)
2. **Effective UID**: Processes can gain or ched permissions by changing their UID, think `passwd`
3. **Saved UID**: The UID that is available to the process via some other means.

# Types of permissions

3 basic types, **R**ead, **W**rite, and e**X**ecute

These are applied to each of the three groups defined previously.

# Effect of permissions on Files

| Permission | Character | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read | `-` | The file is not readable |  
|      | `r` | The file is readable |
| Write | `-` | The file cannot be changed or modified |
|       | `w` | The file can be changed or modified |
| Execute | `-` | The file cannot be executed |
| | `x` | The file can be executed |
| | `s` | In the `users` triplet, `setuid`.  If found in the `group` triplet, `setgid`. `s` implies executable but also will execute with the permissions of the owner or group (for `setuid` and `setgid` respectively.) | 
| | `S` | Same as `s` but does not imply executable.  Not useful on files. |
| | `t` | If found in `others` triplet sets sticky bit. Implies `x`.  Does nothing on files. |
| | `T` | Same as `t` but does not imply `x`.  Also does nothing on files. |

# Effect of permissions on Directories (folders)

| Permission | Character | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read | `-` | Directory contents cannot be listed |
|      | `r` | Directory contents can be listed |
| Write | `-` | Directory contents cannot be altered |
|       | `w` | Directory content can be altered (files can be added or removed) |
| Execute | `-` | Directory cannot be changed to (cannot `cd`) |
| | `x` | Directory can be changed to |
| | `s` | If in `user` triplet, `setuid` (which does nothing); in `group` triplet, `setgid`.  On folders `setgid` means new files inherit the same group as the parent folder. |
| | `S` | Same as `s` but does not imply `x`.  Useless on directories. |
| | `t` | In the `other` triplet, sets the sticky bit.  When set, files in this directory can only be modified by their owner, the folder owner, or the root user. |
| | `T` | Useless on directories. |

# root, sudo, and security

the `root` user is the highest level of access on a system.

`sudo` or "super-user do" allows you to execute commands as the `root` user.

You can allow/deny access to the full `sudo` command in most systems with the sudo group in `/etc/group`

You can specify command specific use of `sudo` with the `visudo` command.
This allows specified users and groups access to use all or a subset of available commands with sudo permissions.

For security reasons we want to restrict the use of root and sudo as much as possible!

* limit access to sudo to only those that need it
* limit use of sudo to only the commands that need elevated privileges

# Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

>  Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job. -Jerome Saltzer, *Communications of the ACM*

* Very useful principle
* Nearly impossible in practice (too much complexity)
* still useful across all areas of cyber security

---

# CIA

* We can protect ***Confidentiality*** by restricting `others` access to files and limiting access to groups.
* We can protect ***Integrity*** by limiting `write` access to files.
* We can ensure ***Availability*** by ensuring users that need access to files are in the proper groups.

---

# Limitations of basic Linux File Permissions

Files can only have one owner and one group.

ACL's allow for finer permissions settings per file.

`setfacl` and `getfacl` allow for additional user/group triplets.

* `setfacl -m u:<username>:<triplet> <filename>`
* `setfacl -m g:<groupname>:<triplet> <filename>`
