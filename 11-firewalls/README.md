# Network Security Systems

A brief overview of some basic network security systems.

# Iptables and Firewalls

From Wikipedia:

> A firewall is a network security system that
> monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network
> traffic based on predetermined security rules.  
> A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a
> trusted network and an untrusted network.

# Firewall examples: AWS

```
 MyExampleSecurityGroup:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup'
    Properties:
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: '22'
          ToPort: '22'
          CidrIp: 130.108.0.0/16
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: '1025'
          ToPort: '2048'
          CidrIp: 130.108.0.0/16
        - IpProtocol: -1
          FromPort: '-1'
          ToPort: '-1'
          CidrIp: 10.0.0.0/16

# Firewall examples: `iptables`

```bash
# Generated by iptables-save v1.8.7 on <date>
*filter
:INPUT DROP [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp --match multiport --dports 1025:2048 \
    -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -s 10.0.0.0/16 -j ACCEPT
COMMIT
```

# Firewall Types

### **Packet filters**

  * **Stateless** filters check basic information like port 
    number, IP address, protocol, etc. of a packet to take action.
  * **Stateful** filters maintain records of conections passing through,
    can determine if a packet is the start of a new connection or a part of an 
    existing connection.  In `iptables` the four trackable states are
    **NEW**, **ESTABLISHED**, **RELATED** and **INVALID**.

### **Application Layer**
  
  * works more like a proxy, can "understand" applications and protocols.
  * frequently inspects contents of traffic.

---

# Firewall Policies

### **Blacklist** approach (default-allow)

  * All packets are allowed through except those that fit the defined blacklist.
  * Pros: flexible, less likely to impact services.
  * Cons: unexpected malicious traffic makes it through.
  * ***Lab Task 3***

### **Whitelist** approach (default-deny)
  
  * All packets are dropped or rejected unless specifically allowed.
  * Pros: safer network
  * Cons: unexpected important traffic gets dropped or rejected.
  * ***Lab Task 4***

---

# Firewall Rules

  Firewalls take one of three actions on a packet.

  * *Allow* lets the packet pass through.
  * *Drop* prevents the packet from passing but is silent about it.
  * *Reject* prevents the packet from passing but notifies the sender that it is being blocked.

  
# `ipchains`

`iptables` specfically has multiple `chains` of rules that apply, 
here are the 5 predetermined ones:
  
  * `PREROUTING` are rules applied to all packets before any routing decisions are made.
  * `INPUT` are rules applied on packets that will be delivered locally.
  * `FORWARD` are rules applying to packets that have been routed but are not for locally delivery
  * `OUTPUT` are packets sent by the local machine.
  * `POSTROUTING` again are all packets but after they have been through all previous relevant chains.

---

# `iptables` tables

Each of the chains defined previously can be applied to 
different tables depending on intent for the packet.

### `*filter`
For packets that are destined locally and only to be filtered (allowed through or dropped) rules go in the `filter` table.

### `*nat`
For packets destined elsewhere and that will need to be altered there is a `nat` table.

### `*mangle`
For all other custom packet manipulation there is a `mangle` table.

# NAT (for l337 gamers and programmers)

NAT stands for [Network Address Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)

This is what allows your non-routable private network 
`192.168.1.0/24` access to the internet.

Lets say you want to make a connection to google.com:80

```
Your computer        Router
==============     =============
|            |     |           |
| port 31746 |====>|           |
|            |     |           |
==============     =============
```

---

```
                     Router            www.google.com
                   =============     ==================
                   |           |     |                |
                   | port 21283|====>| port 80        |
                   |           |     |                |
                   =============     ==================


                     Router            www.google.com
                   =============     ==================
                   |           |     |                |
                   | port 21283|<====| port 80        |
                   |           |     |                |
                   =============     ==================
```

# Open NAT

All traffic coming in to your Router on a given port gets 
sent to your computer.

```
Your computer        Router
==============     =============      www.google.com:80
|            |     |           |      www.google.com:443
| port 31746 |<====| port 21283|<==== serverfault.com:80
|            |     |           |      fbi.gov:32188
==============     =============      botnet.cn:11288
```

---

# Moderate NAT

Only traffic from a specified *host* gets sent back through to your PC.

```
Your computer        Router
==============     =============      www.google.com:80
|            |     |           |      www.google.com:443
| port 31746 |<====| port 21283|<====  x (rejected) serverfault.com:80
|            |     |           |       x (rejected) fbi.gov:32188
==============     =============       x (rejected) botnet.cn:11288
```

---

# Strict NAT

Only responses from the requested *host* **and** *port* are sent back to your pc.

```
Your computer        Router
==============     =============      www.google.com:80
|            |     |           |       x (rejected) www.google.com:443
| port 31746 |<====| port 21283|<====  x (rejected) serverfault.com:80
|            |     |           |       x (rejected) fbi.gov:32188
==============     =============       x (rejected) botnet.cn:11288
```

# IPtables notes for the lab

* iptables do not persist through a reboot (so if you lock yourself out you can reboot to get back in)
* iptables can be annoying
* dropping all inbound connections (without any exceptions) will break everything
  * the above will not allow any form of remote communications with the target, which is very annoying ;)
