# Vulnerability Taxonomies

Objectives: Understand common vulnerbility taxonomies and how they relate.

* U.S. National Vulnerability Database ***NVD***
* Common Platform Enumeration ***CPE***
* Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ***CVE***
* Common Vulnerability Scoring System ***CVSS***
* Common Weakness Enumeration ***CWE***
* Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification ***CAPEC***
* Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge ***ATT&CK***
* Open Web Application Security Project ***OWASP***

## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

* Founded in 1901
* Standards organization responsible for weights, measurements, and cybersecurity standards
* Also has a solid (if small) [page of memes](https://www.nist.gov/education/memes-nist)

## U.S. National Vulnerability Database ***NVD***

* Created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
* repository of standards based Vulnerability management data
* Includes multiple databases of security checklists,
  security related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.
* CVE, CVSS, and others are all a part of the NVD

---

## Common Platform Enumeration ***CPE***

* Basically just an official naming and versioning scheme for IT systems, software, and packages.
* Try using it on one of your projects sometime!
* Contains a dictionary of platform names and versions to automate decisions based on known vulnerabilities.

[CPE](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol/specifications/cpe)

---

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ***CVE***

* Reference method for publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures
* A CVE name/number/ID is a unique identifier for a a single vulnerbility
* Only CVE Numbering Authorities (CNA) can issue CVE's
  * MITRE is the primary CNA
  * Various companies can assign CVE numbers for their own products 
    (Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, etc.)
* CVE database contains several specified fields

## CVE Further information and search

* [CVE Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)
* [NVD CVE Lookup](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)
* [MITRE CVE Lookup](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html)

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System ***CVSS***

* Given the growing number of CVE's each year we need a way to focus on the most important ones
* CVSS is a means of assigning a numerical score based on the ***severity*** of a given CVE
* Scores range from 0 to 10, low being not very important and 10 being a critical security vulnerability
* Several changes to this scoring metric have occured, be sure you are comparing similar versions of CVSS scores

[CVSS Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System)

---

## Common Weakness Enumeration ***CWE***

* Category system for software and hardware weaknesses and vulnerabilities 
* Over 600 categories including
  * Buffer Overflow
  * path/directory traversal errors
  * hard-coded passwords
  * insecure random numbers... etc.

[CWE Top 25](http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2021/2021_cwe_top25.html)

---

## Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification ***CAPEC***

* Public catalog of common attack patterns to help users understand how weaknesses are exploited
* Based on Software Design Patterns
* Relates weaknesses (CWE) and vulnerbilities (CVE).
* Similar to CWE, the same CAPEC may apply to many CVEs
* [CAPEC-139: Relative Path Traversal](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/139.html)

---

## Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge ***ATT&CK***

* Knowledge base of adversarial tactics
* The more you know (or a more theatrical: know your enemy)

[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)

---

## CAPEC & ATT&CK

Use CAPEC for:

* Application threat modeling
* Developer training and education
* Penetration testing

Use ATT&CK for:

* Comparing computer network defense capabilities
* Defending against the Advanced Persistent Threat
* Hunting for new threats
* Enhancing threat intelligence
* Adversary emulation exercises


---

## Open Web Application Security Project ***OWASP***

MITRE is just one (pretty big) organization.  There are others that attempt to classify similar things.

OWASP is a community that attempts similar classification for just web applications.

## Homework

Properly Formatted `Yourname.md` uploaded to pilot.  Style counts, I will be reading this in Github!.

* Read this: [top 25 software CWE's](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2022/2022_cwe_top25.html)
* Choose 1 of the top 25 (or honestly any known CSE) that you have personally put in code you used/submitted.  Do a deep dive on  that CWE (read all about it).
* Write up (at least) three paragraphs on the CWE, how your code was vulnerable to it, and how you could have changed the code to not be vulnerable.  
  
* Be sure to include: 
  * What it is, in your own words
  * At least one CVE with an explanation of what it was
  * What your personal experience is with the CWE
  * How you could have fixed it (what would you need to have done to not implement this weakness in your code)
